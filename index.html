<h1>Save Electricity</h1>

<p class="par"><span class="span">All of us must understand that even a small step will go a very long way<br> in saving electricity. For instance, if every person at each home switches on the<br> fan when not in use, thousands of watts of electricity can be saved.

 Similarly, if we use our air conditioners, heaters, ovens, refrigerators and<br> more properly, we can successfully save large amounts of electricity.<br>
Furthermore, try making use of natural light more. Do not keep the lights <br>unnecessarily in the morning and afternoons. <br>Make do with the natural light as it is enough. We must replace all our old<br> appliances as they consume a lot of electricity. In other words, we must strive<br> to make our homes energy efficient.<br>

Moreover, always remember to unplug your electrical gadgets when not in use.<br> These devices consume at least 10% of electricity even when inactive. Thus, unplug<br> them to save electricity.<br> 

Most importantly, installing solar panels can help you excessively. They are very<br> economical and help in saving a lot of energy. The solar panels will help in consuming<br> lesser energy that too economically.<br> Similarly, the industries which use megawatts of electricity must install windmills.<br> This can help in getting cheap electricity through natural means.<br></span></p>
